# Shooting-Words

Learning Languages is hard and boring. Most Modern Solutions to be the problem are quiz apps and space repetition software which in the experience and journey of language learning turn out to be ineffective. Therefore, we made an educational game designed to help you learn new languages in a fun and engaging way. This game is suitable for a beginner who wants to learn a new language. There are three game made in this repository, a python game made using pygame and two unity games which all are free and open-source to be edited and modified according to a person's needs. 

# Game Play :<br/>
The game is a shooter game where you play as a character. 
A player is given a prompt asking him the translation of word ( for e.g., water ) to the language which he / she is learning. Enemies spawn each with a word attached to them, the player must kill the enemy which has the correct translation of the word attached to it ( for e.g., 4 enemies would have 4 Hindi words attached to them, as the player has to kill the translation of the word water, he would kill the word "Panni" ) after another prompt is given to the player and the loop continues.
The game supports languages such as Hindi and German. Though, we only have a few lines, Lines can be added by the user.
